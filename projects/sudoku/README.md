# Sudoku â€” Competitive Programming CLI & Analysis Tool

## Overview

Sudoku is a Python-based CLI tool designed to help competitive programmers **discover, analyze, and learn from Codeforces problems interactively**. The project combines **web scraping, natural language processing, and AI-powered analysis** to create a structured learning experience, complete with curated problem insights, code examples, and algorithmic roadmaps.

The tool is particularly aimed at **intermediate to advanced learners** who want to enhance their problem-solving skills efficiently and systematically.

## Key Features

1. **Interactive CLI**

   * Search for problems by tags (e.g., `math`, `dp`, `graphs`).
   * Select a random problem within a desired rating range.
   * View previously shown problems to avoid repetition.
   * Easily fetch and display problem statements and examples.

2. **Automated Problem Fetching**

   * Integrates with the **Codeforces API** to fetch the latest problems.
   * Scrapes problem statements, sample inputs/outputs, time/memory limits, and metadata.
   * Implements robust retry and backoff logic for network reliability.

3. **AI-Powered Problem Analysis**

   * Leverages **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** to generate:

     * Concise problem summaries
     * General themes and problem-solving patterns
     * Relevant algorithms and data structures (from basic to advanced)
     * Real-world analogies and system-level insights
     * Step-by-step learning roadmap
     * Illustrated code samples and best practices
   * Ensures responses are **structured, actionable, and citable**.

4. **Markdown Generation & Storage**

   * Converts problem statements (HTML + LaTeX) into **clean Markdown** for readability.
   * Formats sample tests, code snippets, and AI analysis for easy offline study.
   * Saves all problem analyses in `~/.sudoku/problems/` for long-term reference.

5. **Enhanced Learning Support**

   * Provides recommended resources (books, tutorials, papers, links).
   * Highlights **common pitfalls** and mistakes.
   * Offers a **learning checklist** to progressively master algorithms and data structures.

## Architecture & Workflow

### 1. Problem Retrieval

* Fetches problems from Codeforces API (`/problemset.problems`).
* Uses BeautifulSoup to parse HTML problem pages.
* Cleans LaTeX/math formatting and extracts sample inputs/outputs.

### 2. AI Analysis Pipeline

* Problem Markdown is sent to OpenAI API for **deep analysis**.
* Generates **7 structured sections** including summary, patterns, techniques, code samples, and roadmap.
* Markdown is formatted with headings, bullet points, and code blocks for readability.

### 3. CLI Interaction

* Commands include:

  * `random [max_rating]`: Fetch a random problem within rating threshold.
  * `tag <tag>`: Search for problems by topic.
  * `show`: Display the full problem statement with AI analysis.
  * `quit/exit`: Exit the CLI safely.
* Stores shown problems in JSON to prevent repetition.

### 4. Data Management

* Problem metadata and analysis are persisted locally in `~/.sudoku`.
* Ensures reproducibility and offline access.

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3.10+**
* **Web Scraping:** `requests`, `BeautifulSoup4`
* **Markdown Formatting:** `markdownify`, `mdformat`
* **ASCII Art:** `art`
* **Environment & Configuration:** `dotenv`
* **AI Integration:** `openai` (GPT-4o-mini)
* **Data Handling:** JSON, pathlib, datetime

## Example Workflow

1. Launch CLI -> `python3 main.py`
2. Fetch a random problem under rating 1200 -> `random 1200`,
3. Display the problem with AI-powered analysis -> `show`
4. View concise summary, relevant algorithms, and code snippets generated by GPT.
5. Store and revisit problems locally for consistent practice.

## Learning Outcomes

* Deep understanding of **competitive programming patterns**: graphs, dynamic programming, number theory, strings, data structures, etc.
* Exposure to **AI-assisted problem analysis** and structured learning techniques.
* Practical experience in **web scraping, Markdown processing, and CLI design**.
* Familiarity with **Codeforces API**, problem metadata, and real-world algorithm applications.

---

## Future Enhancements

* **Advanced filtering** by difficulty, contest type, or tags.
* **Personalized learning paths** based on user history.
* **Support for other competitive platforms**: LeetCode, AtCoder, HackerRank.
* **Automated practice scheduling and progress tracking**.
* **GUI or web-based interface** with interactive visualizations.
