# Manifesto

A manifesto.

I started this project because I didn’t want to stay lost.

There’s too much great research happening — in labs, universities, and teams all over the world — but the path to find it is unclear. Most students don’t know where to begin. Most researchers don’t know how to stay in sync. And many of us spend years figuring out what we should have known from the start.

This lab exists to change that.

I’m building a system that makes the research landscape easier to see, follow, and contribute to. A system that:

- Links researchers, universities, grants, and papers
- Helps people discover real work, not just rankings
- Keeps us in sync with what matters, not what’s trending
- Makes progress visible

This isn’t just for me. It’s for anyone who wants to build a meaningful path in research — especially those who don’t have access, mentors, or guidance.

I don’t have all the answers. But I do have a clear goal: To make it easier for people to find where their minds belong.

This is my way forward.

Who is this for?

- The brilliant undergrad in Karachi who doesn’t know where to start
- The high schooler in Lagos trying to find real professors working on AI safety
- The lonely master’s student in Brazil wondering where their skills can serve
- The rejected applicant in Delhi asking, “Was I ever even seen?”
