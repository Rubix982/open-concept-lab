I am trying to work on a new novel research model for AI. The entire idea is documented in vision.md,
but the overall essence of the idea is first the ingestion of research papers and being able to
derive facts from each of the papers such that they can be referred to. This system will help
figure out new novel ideas and help connect research in a better. I would prefer that we create
an agent team to explore this from different angles: one is a researcher who has some expertise
when it comes to training new novel architecture, the other is a developer that is working on the
individual pipelines and data process, and the third person is a validator or QA that is trying to
see how much of the project is now in usable shape. A fourth person, the product manager, can see
that we have existing scripts under src/ and tests/, and there is some data already fetched under
data/ and demo_data/ ... and is trying to help the rest of the team understand how it all interconnects
together.
