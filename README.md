# 🧪 open-concept-lab

A long-term, exploratory lab of **concept projects** focused on the foundations of AI, Security, Systems, and High-Performance Computing — and how they intersect in real-world tools, protocols, and research.

This repository serves as a place to:

- Build from first principles and implement key ideas from scratch
- Document thought processes, tradeoffs, and experiments
- Reflect on challenges, gaps in understanding, and future possibilities

## 🎯 Purpose

- 🔍 Explore complex topics by building minimal, focused implementations  
- ✍️ Develop strong conceptual intuition through code, reflection, and iteration  
- 🧠 Think out loud through README files, notes, and extension plans  
- 🔗 Bridge theory and tooling across AI, security, and systems

Over time, this is intended to become a **public notebook of ideas** — part playground, part documentation hub, part future research garden.

## 📁 Repository Structure

```sh
.
├── ai/                # Neural networks, transformers, LLM agents, evaluation
├── hpc/               # Parallelism, matrix ops, performance tuning
├── security/          # TLS, sandboxes, analysis tools, crypto experiments
├── systems/           # OS components, allocators, consensus algorithms
├── reproducibility/   # Benchmarks, paper replications, repeatable results
├── tooling/           # CLI experiments, test kits, automation utilities
├── templates/         # Reusable README + reflection + extension templates
└── meta/              # Personal or meta information I keep a track of privately
```

Each folder includes a `README.md` for high-level structure.

## 📘 Project Structure

Each individual project in this lab typically includes:

* `README.md` — What was built, why it matters, and how it connects to the field
* `reflection.md` — What worked, what didn't, what surprised me
* `extension.md` — How I'd take this further if I turned it into a real tool or research idea

Templates live in `/templates/` and evolve as I learn more.

## 🧠 What You'll Find Here

Some test, sample ideas I wrote down below.

| Domain          | Sample Ideas                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AI              | Transformers from scratch, multilingual evaluation agents     |
| Security        | Minimal TLS, static analyzers, seccomp + container sandboxing |
| Systems         | OS schedulers, memory allocators, Paxos logs in Rust          |
| HPC             | Parallel sorting, matrix ops with OpenMP/CUDA                 |
| Tooling         | LLM testbeds, CLI utils, security scanners                    |
| Reproducibility | Recreating results from papers, metrics, and plots            |

## 🧱 Why This Lab Exists

I've always believed that true understanding comes from doing — from touching the internals of the ideas we study. This lab is my way of getting closer to those internals. In the end, I want to produce an extensive view into my research goals and interests and find a way to balance practical projects with theoretical understandings.
