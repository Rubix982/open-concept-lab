# 🧪 open-concept-lab

A long-term, exploratory lab of **concept projects** focused on the foundations of AI, Security, Systems, and High-Performance Computing — and how they intersect in real-world tools, protocols, and research.

This lab serves as a place to:

- Build from first principles and implement key ideas from scratch
- Document thought processes, tradeoffs, and experiments
- Reflect on challenges, gaps in understanding, and future possibilities
- Stay in sync with what’s being researched and built across DeepMind, OpenAI, Stanford, ETH Zurich, and other leading institutions
- Maintain tooling to track and _stay in touch_ with research updates, conferences, and scholarly progress
