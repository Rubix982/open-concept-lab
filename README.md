# 🧪 open-concept-lab

A long-term, exploratory lab of **concept projects** focused on the foundations of AI, Security, Systems, and High-Performance Computing — and how they intersect in real-world tools, protocols, and research.

This lab serves as a place to:

- Build from first principles and implement key ideas from scratch
- Document thought processes, tradeoffs, and experiments
- Reflect on challenges, gaps in understanding, and future possibilities
- Stay in sync with what’s being researched and built across DeepMind, OpenAI, Stanford, ETH Zurich, and other leading institutions
- Maintain tooling to track and _stay in touch_ with research updates, conferences, and scholarly progress

## 🎯 Purpose

- 🔍 Explore complex topics through minimal, focused implementations
- ✍️ Develop conceptual intuition via code, reflection, and iteration
- 🧠 Think out loud through README files, dev notes, and extension plans
- 🔗 Bridge theory and tooling across AI, security, and systems
- 🔭 Track and amplify research aligned with world-class labs

This is meant to be a **public notebook of ideas** — part playground, part documentation hub, part future research garden.

## 📁 Repository Structure

```sh
.
├── ai/                # Neural networks, transformers, LLM agents, evaluation
├── hpc/               # Parallelism, matrix ops, performance tuning
├── security/          # TLS, sandboxes, analysis tools, crypto experiments
├── systems/           # OS components, allocators, consensus algorithms
├── reproducibility/   # Benchmarks, paper replications, repeatable results
├── tooling/           # CLI experiments, test kits, automation utilities
├── rank-nsf-linker/   # Track researchers, venues, NSF grants, recent trends
├── templates/         # Reusable README + reflection + extension templates
└── meta/              # Personal or meta information I track privately
```

Each folder includes a `README.md` for high-level structure and status.

## 📘 Project Structure

Each project typically contains:

- `README.md` — What was built, why it matters, and how it connects
- `reflection.md` — What worked, what didn’t, what surprised me
- `extension.md` — How I’d scale this further as a tool or research direction

Templates for all of these live in `/templates/`.

## 🛡️ Why This Lab Exists

I’ve always believed real understanding begins when we build things ourselves.

This lab is my way of diving into the internal mechanics of research — not just reading papers, but recreating and rethinking them. Not just building tools, but making sure they align with where the field is heading.

In the end, I want to:

- 🎯 Prove the kind of research engineer I am becoming
- 🧠 Think and build like the people I admire in labs across the world
- ↺ Keep pace with papers, researchers, and meaningful tools
- ✍️ Document the struggle, the learning curve, and the breakthroughs
- 🌱 Grow this as a living, open-source intellectual garden
