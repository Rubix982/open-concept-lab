# Extension Ideas: {{ PROJECT_TITLE }}

> "If I were turning this into a research project or paper..."

---

## ðŸ”¬ Research Directions

- Investigate how {{ key idea }} scales with {{ dataset/input/model }}.
- Add evaluation metrics for {{ quality, speed, correctness, etc. }}.
- Extend to support {{ broader case or different paradigm }}.

## ðŸ“Š Potential Experiments

- Compare this implementation against {{ baseline tool/approach }} on {{ metrics }}.
- Run a benchmark with {{ dataset / input class }} to test performance limits.
- Visualize internal behavior using {{ logging / tracing / UI }}.

## ðŸ§± Real-World Use Cases

- Could be used in:
  - Teaching {{ course topic }}
  - Simulating {{ attack / model / protocol }}
  - Embedding in a research pipeline for {{ task }}

## ðŸ’¡ Future Plans

- [ ] Add unit tests or formal verification
- [ ] Package this as a CLI or microservice
- [ ] Write a blog post / notebook on key learnings
